Disclaimer: I don't own the copyrights of the code , It was written and coded as
            followed on the youtube channel mentioned above
            P.S: the code has been modified according to the updated structure of the website for 
                 webscraping, there are fields/data that I couldn't able to find, for reading
                 purposes the old lines of code is commented and updated code added underneath
                 for better understanding.please take a note that I have changed the names of the column and files according to my need
                   , if you are copy pasting this code you have to look for syntax errors in names of files and
                   data-columns that are used in tutorial.
